    With the bot, all you have to do is invite it, and do m!backup create [#channel] [Howmanymessages,max=100,max for pro=600]
      Then, it will send you a ID that you can write down and whenever you want to load the backup, you just paste that id in!
      Forgot the id? Dont worry! You can list your backups! Oh no, Someone took my id! Thats ok, if someone has your id, they cannot do anything
